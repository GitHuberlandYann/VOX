  - Game tick 20 times per second
  - Block update
	on each game tick, in each 16x16x16 cube 3 blocks are randomly selected
  - Grass block
	For a dirt block to accept grass from a nearby grass block, the following requirements must be met:
		The dirt block receiving grass must be within a 3x5x3 range of the source grass block where the source block is in the center of the second topmost layer of that range.
		The source grass block must have a light level of 9 or brighter directly above it.
		The block directly above the dirt block must allow light to pass through it and hit the dirt block, even though the actual light level does not matter. That means blocks that partially let light through such as stairs and slabs must not have their light-blocking side(s) facing the dirt block.
		The block directly above the dirt block must not be lava, water, or a waterlogged variant of a block.
	When grass is random ticked, it spreads by checking 4 blocks within range and converts any dirt blocks selected into grass.
  - CROPS
	During every update (block update), a crop plant gets a chance to grow to the next stage with the exact chance depending on conditions:

    As noted above, growth requires a light level of at least 9 in the block above the plant.
    The growth probability is 1/(floor(25/points) + 1), where "points" is as follows:
        The farmland block the crop is planted on gives 2 points if dry or 4 if hydrated.
        For each of the 8 blocks around the block on which the crop is planted, dry farmland gives 0.25 points, and hydrated farmland gives 0.75.
            Note that if a field is bordered with anything besides more farmland, the plants at the edge grow more slowly.
    Having a crop of the same type diagonally from another of the same type will halve the growth rates of both crops. This does not stack.
  
  - Overworld biome generation is based on 6 parameters:
    Temperature, Humidity (aka. Vegetation), Continentalness (aka. Continents), Erosion, Weirdness (aka. Ridges) and Depth, which are calculated with 6 density functions.
    Except "depth", the other 5 parameters are based on only horizontal coordinates. 
    - The TEMPERATURE parameter is a noise parameter used only in biome generation and do not affect terrain generation.
        - The range of temperature is about from -2.31 to +2.31. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0. 5 levels
        - -2.31~-0.45, -0.45~-0.15, -0.15~0.2, 0.2~0.55, 0.55~2.31
    - The HUMIDITY (also known as vegetation) parameter is a noise parameter used only in biome generation and do not affect terrain generation.
        - The range of humidity is about from -1.76 to +1.76. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0. 5 levels
        - -1.76~-0.35, -0.35~-0.1, -0.1~0.1, 0.1~0.3, 0.3~1.76
    - The CONTINENTALNESS (also known as continents) parameter is used to decide between ocean/beach/land biomes.
        It affects the terrain height during terrain generation. The larger the continentalness, the higher the average terrain height.
        And when the continentality is extremely low, the terrain height also becomes higher, in order to generate mushroom fields in the center of the ocean.
        - The range of continentalness is about from -3.80 to +3.80 . Biome intervals are defined only from -1.2 to +1.0.
            - -3.80~-1.05, the mushroom fields biome is generated;
            - when it is between -1.05~-0.455, deep ocean biomes are generated;
            - when -0.455~-0.19, ocean biomes are generated;
            - when -0.19~3.80, inland biomes are generated.
            - For inland biomes, continentalness values are further subdivided into 4 types:
                - coast (-0.19~-0.11)
                - near-inland (-0.11~0.03)
                - mid-inland (0.03~0.3)
                - far-inland (0.3~1.0).
    - The EROSION parameters mainly affect inland terrain during terrain generation. The higher the erosion at a location, the lower the terrain height and the flatter the terrain.
        - The range of erosion is about from -2.52 to +2.52. Biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0. 6 levels
        - -2.52~-0.78, -0.78~-0.375, -0.375~-0.2225, -0.2225~0.05, 0.05~0.45, 0.45~0.55, 0.55~2.52
    - The WEIRDNESS (also known as ridges) parameter affects whether to generate a weirder biome or not.
        (If the weirdness value is greater than 0, the generated biome becomes weirder.
        For example, using the variant of the Jungle biome — Bamboo Jungle; not using beach biomes when on the coast. )
        - The range of weirdness is about from -2.97 to +2.97. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.
        - The PV ("PEAKS AND VALLEYS", aka. "ridges folded") value is calculated through the formula 1 − | 3 | w e i r d n e s s | − 2 |
            - When the weirdness value is between -1.0 and 1.0, the PV values are divided into 5 levels:
                If the PV is -1.0~-0.85, the PV level is "Valleys";
                If -0.85~-0.6, "Low Slice";
                If -0.6~0.2, "Mid Slice";
                If 0.2~0.7, "High Slice";
                If 0.7~1, "Peaks".
                Not that the PV value is defined no matter what the weirdness is, but these 5 PV levels are defined only when weirdness is between -1.0 and 1.0.
    - DEPTH is used for cave generation .. not sure I'll use it for now

- Mobs: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn
	Most mobs have a spawning cycle once every game tick (1/20 of a second),
		but passive mobs have only one spawning cycle every 400 game ticks (20 seconds).
	Most animals spawn within chunks when they are generated.
	Same as random block update, 3 spawn points are generated by 16x16x16 chunk
	Each individual spawn attempt succeeds only if ALL of the following conditions are met:
		- There must be no players or the world spawn point within a 24 radius block distance (spherical) of the spawning block.
		- Must be within a 128 radius block sphere around the player.
		- The number of loaded mobs of that type must be less than the mob cap for that type.
		- The mob s collision box must not intersect with a solid block.
		- The mob s collision box upon spawning must not collide with another collision box.
			A mob cannot spawn inside of anything that would collide with it upon spawning.
		// - /gamerule doMobSpawning is true
	List goes on, but only for hostile mobs:
		- The difficulty must not be Peaceful.
		- the block directly below it must have a solid, opaque, top surface (this includes upside down slabs, upside down stairs, and others) or be soul sand or a slime block.
		- the mob s collision box must not collide with any liquid.
		- The block above the spawning block must be transparent. (ie head block)
		- block light level must be 0 and sky light must be 7 or below.

- Mobs: despawn
	- A mob that has had no player within 32 blocks of it for more than 30 seconds, or 10 seconds if in low light levels,
		has a 1/800 chance of despawning on each game tick
	- immediately if no player is within 128 blocks of it
	- hostile despawns if the difficulty is set to Peaceful
	- Mobs are persistent, meaning they do not despawn and do not count toward the mob cap, when they:
		- are a passenger to another mob or entity.
		// - have had something added to their inventory, including having something dispensed upon them.
		- have been named with a name tag.

- Mobs: 7 categories
	// - passive: the block directly below the spawning block must be a grass block.
	// - water creature: (squids and dolphins)
	// - underground water creature: (glow squids)
	// - axolotls
	// - water ambient: (all 4 types of fish)
	// - ambient: (bat).
	- hostile:
		Mob cap is 70.
		- Zombie:
			- spawn on solid block in group 2-4
			- pursue player if on sight from 35 blocks away
			- burns under direct sunlight (ie 15), stop burning at light level 11 or in water
			- same health as player 20 (10 hearths)
			- damage: easy 2.5, normal 3, hard 4.5
			- drops 1-2 rotten flesh, 2.5% drop 1 iron ingot OR 1 carrot OR 1 potato
			- damaged zombie mobs call all other zombies within a 67x21x67 to 111x21x111 area centered on the attacked zombie to target the attacker.
			- In Hard difficulty, zombies can spawn additional zombies to "help" when damaged.
				Each zombie has a "likeliness to call reinforcements" statistic ranging from 0-10%.
				When the zombie is damaged by an entity or is damaged while targeting an entity, up to 50 attempts are made to randomly choose a spawn location
				(0 or ±7-40 blocks away in all three axes) that is above a block with a solid top surface, has light level 0, has no players within 7 blocks,
				and has no colliding entities or blocks, at which to spawn the reinforcement.
				Both the damaged zombie and the new zombie has a 5 percentage point penalty to their "likeliness to call reinforcement" stat,
				preventing infinite zombies from spawning this way.
