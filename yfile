Some info:
  - Sprinting allows the player to move at around 5.612 meters/second, which is 30 percent faster than the normal walking speed of around 4.317 m/s, jumping while sprinting allows the player to move with an average speed of 7.127 m/s. 
  - It takes 1.61 seconds to eat most foods

  - Game tick 20 times per second
  - Block update
	on each game tick, in each 16x16x16 cube 3 blocks are randomly selected
  - Grass block
	For a dirt block to accept grass from a nearby grass block, the following requirements must be met:
		The dirt block receiving grass must be within a 3x5x3 range of the source grass block where the source block is in the center of the second topmost layer of that range.
		The source grass block must have a light level of 9 or brighter directly above it.
		The block directly above the dirt block must allow light to pass through it and hit the dirt block, even though the actual light level does not matter. That means blocks that partially let light through such as stairs and slabs must not have their light-blocking side(s) facing the dirt block.
		The block directly above the dirt block must not be lava, water, or a waterlogged variant of a block.
	When grass is random ticked, it spreads by checking 4 blocks within range and converts any dirt blocks selected into grass.
  - CROPS
	During every update (block update), a crop plant gets a chance to grow to the next stage with the exact chance depending on conditions:

    As noted above, growth requires a light level of at least 9 in the block above the plant.
    The growth probability is 1/(floor(25/points) + 1), where "points" is as follows:
        The farmland block the crop is planted on gives 2 points if dry or 4 if hydrated.
        For each of the 8 blocks around the block on which the crop is planted, dry farmland gives 0.25 points, and hydrated farmland gives 0.75.
            Note that if a field is bordered with anything besides more farmland, the plants at the edge grow more slowly.
    Having a crop of the same type diagonally from another of the same type will halve the growth rates of both crops. This does not stack.
  
  - Overworld biome generation is based on 6 parameters:
    Temperature, Humidity (aka. Vegetation), Continentalness (aka. Continents), Erosion, Weirdness (aka. Ridges) and Depth, which are calculated with 6 density functions.
    Except "depth", the other 5 parameters are based on only horizontal coordinates. 
    - The TEMPERATURE parameter is a noise parameter used only in biome generation and do not affect terrain generation.
        - The range of temperature is about from -2.31 to +2.31. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0. 5 levels
        - -2.31~-0.45, -0.45~-0.15, -0.15~0.2, 0.2~0.55, 0.55~2.31
    - The HUMIDITY (also known as vegetation) parameter is a noise parameter used only in biome generation and do not affect terrain generation.
        - The range of humidity is about from -1.76 to +1.76. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0. 5 levels
        - -1.76~-0.35, -0.35~-0.1, -0.1~0.1, 0.1~0.3, 0.3~1.76
    - The CONTINENTALNESS (also known as continents) parameter is used to decide between ocean/beach/land biomes.
        It affects the terrain height during terrain generation. The larger the continentalness, the higher the average terrain height.
        And when the continentality is extremely low, the terrain height also becomes higher, in order to generate mushroom fields in the center of the ocean.
        - The range of continentalness is about from -3.80 to +3.80 . Biome intervals are defined only from -1.2 to +1.0.
            - -3.80~-1.05, the mushroom fields biome is generated;
            - when it is between -1.05~-0.455, deep ocean biomes are generated;
            - when -0.455~-0.19, ocean biomes are generated;
            - when -0.19~3.80, inland biomes are generated.
            - For inland biomes, continentalness values are further subdivided into 4 types:
                - coast (-0.19~-0.11)
                - near-inland (-0.11~0.03)
                - mid-inland (0.03~0.3)
                - far-inland (0.3~1.0).
    - The EROSION parameters mainly affect inland terrain during terrain generation. The higher the erosion at a location, the lower the terrain height and the flatter the terrain.
        - The range of erosion is about from -2.52 to +2.52. Biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0. 6 levels
        - -2.52~-0.78, -0.78~-0.375, -0.375~-0.2225, -0.2225~0.05, 0.05~0.45, 0.45~0.55, 0.55~2.52
    - The WEIRDNESS (also known as ridges) parameter affects whether to generate a weirder biome or not.
        (If the weirdness value is greater than 0, the generated biome becomes weirder.
        For example, using the variant of the Jungle biome â€” Bamboo Jungle; not using beach biomes when on the coast. )
        - The range of weirdness is about from -2.97 to +2.97. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.
        - The PV ("PEAKS AND VALLEYS", aka. "ridges folded") value is calculated through the formula 1 âˆ’ | 3 | w e i r d n e s s | âˆ’ 2 |
            - When the weirdness value is between -1.0 and 1.0, the PV values are divided into 5 levels:
                If the PV is -1.0~-0.85, the PV level is "Valleys";
                If -0.85~-0.6, "Low Slice";
                If -0.6~0.2, "Mid Slice";
                If 0.2~0.7, "High Slice";
                If 0.7~1, "Peaks".
                Not that the PV value is defined no matter what the weirdness is, but these 5 PV levels are defined only when weirdness is between -1.0 and 1.0.
    - DEPTH is used for cave generation .. not sure I'll use it for now
